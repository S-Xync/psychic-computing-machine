The Green500 list: This list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers that were created and maintained by professors in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. This project involves creating and maintaining the database that drives the website. Dowload the data at [top 500](https://www.top500.org/files/green500/green500_top_201611.xlsx), create a schema for this data, storing the data using this schema, and enabling queries to be made, as in these [examples](http://www.top500.org/sublist).

You can find the documentation of this project in [wiki](https://github.com/s-xync/psychic-computing-machine/wiki) of this Github project.
